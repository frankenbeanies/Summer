Two [1], both alike in dignity, In fair [2], wehre we lay our scene,  From ancient [3] break to new muntiny, Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.  From forth the fatal loins of these two foes  A pair of star-cross'd [4] take their life;  Whole misadventured piteous overthrows  DO with their[5] bury their parens' strife.
